# The Name Hall of Fame
The Name Hall of Fame is a pet project I've been working on with my brother.  The idea is born of inside joke between us and our friend Collin and
the purpose is to document the greatest names ever bequeathed.

Names are submitted by the public but only are added to the list if they have a corresponding wikipedia page.
